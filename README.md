## CO2 Emissions and Sources: A Comparative Study in Bangladesh
This is a qualitative research paper and data analytics project.

The main objective of this study is to identify the major contributors to CO2 emissions in
Bangladesh and gain a better understanding of which sectors to tackle first to regulate the current
status quo. Specifically, the purpose is to analyze the level of CO2 emissions in Bangladesh
resulting from different sources. We will, in particular, study and compare CO2 emissions due to
urbanization, industrialization, manufacturing industries and construction, commercial and public
services, and consumption of various non-renewable fuels.
